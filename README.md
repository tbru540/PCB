AA Charger Custom PCB

The second version of the board is more compatible, but it brought another problem to be solved. The issue I've discovered is that 4x AA batteries donâ€™t supply enough voltage to sustain 5v. Version 2 proved it can supply 6v, but that's just too high for modern smartphones. As a solution, I'll use a battery pack which holds 8 AA batteries, which are widely available on the internet and easy to acquire. I'm trying to avoid having to use 18650 batteries, as they're significantly less likely for people to have laying around the house, so I'm doing my best to try to make it work with AA batteries but that is the backup plan if it just isn't possible. 

Below is a video of version 2 of the PCB board
