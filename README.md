AA Charger Custom PCB

I completely redesigned the board, incorporating a dedicated charging port chip to automatically manipulate D+ and D- for each type of device, as well as incorporated a more modern buck converter into the board itself instead of using an external buck converter module. I've also incorporated a switch to enable power to the USB with a built in LED indiciator, a fuse for overcurrent protection, a TVS diode to protect against voltage spikes, as well as a ferrite bead to suppress EMI. This board was created using KiCad 9.0. 

The files above contain the file to the schematic and the PCB. Also, I've included pictures of the schematic, PCB, and 3D model for easier viewing. The 3D model is a PNG file, while the pictures of the schematic and PCB are JPG files.
