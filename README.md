AA Charger Custom PCB

I completely redesigned the board, incorporating a dedicated charging port chip to automatically manipulate D+ and D- for each type of device, as well as incorporated a more modern buck converter into the board itself instead of using an external buck converter module. I'll post the schematic as I believe this will be close to the final version, with possibly some small, insignificant changes.
