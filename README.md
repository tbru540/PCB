AA Charger Custom PCB

I completely redesigned the board, incorporating a dedicated charging port chip to automatically manipulate D+ and D- for each type of device, as well as incorporated a more modern buck converter into the board itself instead of using an external buck converter module. I've also incorporated a switch to enable power to the USB with a built in LED indiciator, a fuse for overcurrent protection, a TVS diode to protect against voltage spikes, as well as a ferrite bead to suppress EMI.
