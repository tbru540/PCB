AA Charger Custom PCB

The second version of the board is more compatible, but it brought another problem to be solved. The issue I've discovered is that 4x AA batteries donâ€™t supply enough voltage to sustain 5v. Version 2 proved it can supply 6v, but that's just too high for modern smartphones. As a solution, I'll use a battery pack which holds 8 AA batteries, which are widely available on the internet and easy to acquire. 

Below is a video of version 2 of the PCB board
